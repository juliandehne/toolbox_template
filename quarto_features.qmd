This example illustrates the **required** metadata by [`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) for a tutorial written as a Quarto Document, an extension to Markdown [@markdown2004].

Although footnotes are supported, the use of footnotes is discouraged[^1].

[^1]: Because of it makes navigation harder.

Math can be written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and is render by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Both inline, for example $x$, and standalone, for example $$x = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\text{,}$$ is supported.

To draw attention, wrap the text inside a callout blocks.

Cross reference of figures, tables, equations, ... is also supported. For example, see @fig-north.

## Execution of R code

R code can be executed and the output can be included inline, for example `1 + 1` is equal to `r 1 + 1`, and standalone, for example

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1

a + b
```

Annotation of code blocks is also supported. For example,

```r
(3 %/% 2) != (3 %% 2) # <1>
```
1. `%%` calculates the remainder on integer division.

## Creation of figure with R

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = 'svg')
```

```{r}
# We need a deterministic output here because we are using this for unit testing.

# data <- runif(10, min=0, max=10)
data <- c(
  9.0629027,
  5.3972500,
  0.4133466,
  0.3981549,
  6.8776325,
  7.6101721,
  8.9581236
)

plot(data, type='l')
```

## Dependencies

Packages that need to be installed for the reader should be listed in the `install.R` file. For example,

```r
install.packages("units")
```

R packages with system requirements, must have the system requirements installed using the `apt.txt`. For example,

```
libudunits2-dev
```

With the R package in the `install.R` file and the system requirements in the `apt.txt` file, is possible to execute

```{r}
library(units)

spd1 = set_units(1:5, m/s)

spd2 = set_units(1:5, km/h)

spd1 + spd2
```
